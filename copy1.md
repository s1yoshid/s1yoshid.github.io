My name is Shuusei Yoshida and I'm a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from UCSD. First and foremost, I love to build and deconstruct things. Whether it be a computer or a pen, I have the utmost curiosity for how they work. My current interest is in hardware design and more specifically chip design. I made this personal website mostly so that you can get to know all about me, what I'm currently doing, and what I've done at UCSD. Hope you enjoy!
