<h1 class="h1" id="top">Welcome to my website! </h1>

What's up! I'm Shuusei but you can call me Shuu. I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree (B.S.) in Computer Engineering from [University of California - San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). 

I made this portfolio website because résumés can often times exclude fine details with such restricted space. Here you can find a lot more in-depth information on the projects I've worked on and just a little bit more about me.

I love to build and break things. Whether it be a computer or a pen, I have the utmost curiosity for how they work. I've definitely gotten in trouble many times because of this, but for the sake of knowledge I suppose. My current interest is in digital design and more specifically chip design.
