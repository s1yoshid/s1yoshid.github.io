<h1 class="h1" id="about-me">About Me </h1>

What's up! I'm Shuusei but you can call me Shuu. I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree (B.S.) in Computer Engineering from [University of California - San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). 

I made this portfolio website because résumés can often times exclude fine details with such restricted space. Here you can find a lot more in-depth information on the projects I've worked on and just a little bit more about me.

First and foremost, I love to build and break things. Whether it be a computer or a pen, I have the utmost curiosity for how they work. I've definitely gotten in trouble many times because of this, but for the sake of knowledge I suppose. My current interest is in hardware design and more specifically chip design. 

Some of my hobbies include: 
* PC building
* Mechanical keyboard building, which I just started and already spent many monies
* Disc golfing, which is a suprisingly fun and safe way to exercise during COVID
* PC gaming
