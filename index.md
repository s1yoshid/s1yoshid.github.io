<h1 class="h1" id="about-me">About Me </h1>

What's up! I'm Shuusei but you can call me Shuu. I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree (B.S.) in Computer Engineering from [University of California - San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). 

First and foremost, I love to build and deconstruct things. Whether it be a computer or a pen, I have the utmost curiosity for how they work. My current interest is in hardware design and more specifically chip design. I made this personal website mostly so that you can get to know all about me, what I'm currently doing, and what I've done at UCSD. Hope you enjoy!
