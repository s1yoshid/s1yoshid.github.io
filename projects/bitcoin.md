**Under Construction**

This project was for my CSE 148 class at UCSD. As a team of two, we were given a basic five stage pipeline cpu design and were tasked with adding at least four optimization to the design. The time frame was 10 weeks including time to analyze the given base design thus this cpu design is not fully optimized. We considered adding out-of-order execution to the base design, but with only 10 weeks we believed it was just too tedious to fully implement, thus opted for other different solutions.
